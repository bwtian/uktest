## Thank you very much for answer, the data now is updated to: https://github.com/bwtian/uktest
# 1. Dear edzer, I think the Z is not the problem, because I use a regular 3d grid
# 2. With a nugget of 0.0001 as suggested by Jon Skoien have decreaed the max (15 -> 14)
# 3. nmax have a big affect to the predicted value (namx 6~100, max: 16~9)
# 4. Maybe the problem is the outliers, i.e. at shallow depth have high temperature, but no data in deeper

# So my questions
# 1. Is there a way to do auto fitting of Nested model in gstat?
# 2. If there is a outlier as a correct obervation, for example a volcano, could I remove it?
# 3. How to decide a suitable namx value?
# 4. Is it possilbe to use a log backtransfter method to decrease the max value? What is it?
