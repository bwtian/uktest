## Thank you very much for answer
# 1. Dear edzer, I think the Z is not the problem, because I use a regular 3d grid
# 2. With a nugget of 0.0001 as suggested by Jon Skoien have decreaed the value a little
## from 16 to 14 but still quite large
# 3. nmax have a big affect to the predicted value
# 4. Maybe the problem is the outliers, i.e. at shallow depth have high temperature of t~z
